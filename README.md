# Chess with multithreading using Alpha-Beta pruning and minimax algorithm

## Current Features
* Fully working chess game written from scratch
* CPU opponent built using alpha-beta pruning and the minimax algorithm
* Multithreading
* Special chess rules including en passant, castling, and pawn upgrade
* Launch menu to choose your game mode
* Local player versus player (on the same device)
* Random cpu opponent

## Installation
1. Install Python 3
