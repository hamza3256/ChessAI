# Python-Chess 
This is a chess project I started to learn Python and introduce myself to git

## Current Features
* Fully working chess game written from scratch
* CPU opponent built using alpha-beta pruning and the minimax algorithm
* Multithreading
* Special chess rules including en passant, castling, and pawn upgrade
* Launch menu to choose your game mode
* Local player versus player (on the same device)
* Random cpu opponent

## Installation
1. Install Python 3
1. Use pip to install tkinter, PIL, anytree, and threading
1. Run main.py to start the program

## TODO
 * Write neural network game mode
 * Add checkmate indication - checkmate rules are in place
 * Write local network multiplayer
 * More thoroughly document items
 * Clean up parts - many parts are implemented inefficiently
 * Fix unknown bugs in the game
 * Implement smooth drag and drop graphics
 * Make more compatible with alternate resolutions
 * Add rule where a player can get more queens from pawn upgrade
 * Allow the CPU opponent to perform pawn upgrades
